GAlib: A C++ Genetic Algorithm Library

GAlib is a C++ library of genetic algorithm objects.  With GAlib you can add 
genetic algorithm optimization to almost any program using any data 
representation and standard or custom selection, crossover, mutation, 
scaling, and termination methods.  

The library requires a cfront 3.0 compatible C++ compiler.  I have tested 
GAlib on MacOS using Metrowerks and Symantec development environments, 
DOS/Windows using Borland C++, and various UNIX platforms using g++, CC, 
and DCC.  It compiles cleanly with most compilers.  Some genome classes use 
templates, but you can define the NO_TEMPLATES flag if your compiler does 
not understand templates.  The default configuration uses streams, but the 
NO_STREAMS directive lets you turn that off (for use with a GUI, for example).

DOCUMENTATION, UPDATES and MAILING LIST ---------------------------------------

Complete documentation in html format is available in the doc directory.  In
addition, the FTP site contains a PostScript(tm) version of the documentation.
For the most recent installation hints, bug fixes, and announcements, see the
documentation online at http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/

There are two GAlib mailing lists:  galib@mit.edu and galib-announce@mit.edu
The first list is an unmoderated list intended as a forum for galib users to
help each other.  The second is only for announcements about GAlib updates.
To subscribe, send email to galib-request@mit.edu (or galib-announce-request)
with the word 'subscribe' in the subject and nothing in the body of the email.

WHERE TO GET IT ---------------------------------------------------------------

The canonical source for this library is ftp://lancet.mit.edu/pub/ga/
There you will find MacOS, DOS/Windows, and UNIX versions of the library.  The
source code is the same for all platforms - the only difference is the naming
of files.  The FTP site also contains project files for various PC and MacOS
compilers.  Makefiles for UNIX are included in the UNIX distribution.

COMPILATION -------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two things to build: the library and the examples.  You can build
the library as a standalone archive, dll, static library, etc.  Or you can
compile-in only the GAlib files you need for your project.  See the 
Installation.html page in the documentation directory for specific details.

Most problems people have when compiling GAlib are due to template instatiation
issues (not every compiler handles templates the same way).  See the 
installation notes for details.  The notes also include instructions for 
dealing with compilers that do not support templates.

BUGS 'n STUFF -----------------------------------------------------------------

If you use GAlib to solve your problems, please let me know how you used it.
A short paragraph describing the problem(s) on which you are working would be
wonderful :)

Send bug reports and suggestions for improvements to mbwall@mit.edu.  For bug
reports, please include the GAlib version number, machine type, operating 
system and version number, and events that led up to you finding the bug.
